flutter:

  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  fonts:
    - family: Roboto_Medium
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Medium.ttf
    - family: Roboto_Light
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Light.ttf
    - family: Roboto_Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Bold.ttf
    - family: Roboto_Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
